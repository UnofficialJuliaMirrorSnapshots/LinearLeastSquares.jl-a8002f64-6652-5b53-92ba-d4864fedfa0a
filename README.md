LinearLeastSquares.jl (LLS) is a library that makes it easy to formulate and solf least-squares
optimization problems with linear equality constraints. The full documentation is
[available online](http://lls.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). 

LLS is actively maintained for the course EE103, Introduction to Matrix Methods. The course is
typically taught in the fall. You can find accompanying resources and the textbook Vectors, Matrices,
and Least Squares on the Stanford [course website](http://ee103.stanford.edu/mma.html).

Please open an issue on this GitHub repo if you encounter issues with our package.
