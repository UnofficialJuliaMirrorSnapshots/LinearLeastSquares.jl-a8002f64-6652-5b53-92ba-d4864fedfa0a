LLS has been implemented in following languages:

- Julia: `LinearLeastSquares.jl <https://github.com/davidlizeng/LinearLeastSquares.jl>`_ by David Zeng and Karanveer Mohan
- Python: `lsqpy <https://github.com/keegango/lsqpy>`_ by Keegan Go

All implementations of LLS are released under the MIT license.

Much of the design of LLS was inspired by
`Convex.jl <https://github.com/cvxgrp/Convex.jl>`_ and
Steven Diamond's `CVXPY <http://cvxpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_,
similar software packages for solving the much more general class of
convex optimization problems.

A huge thanks to Stephen Boyd for his feedback in both the design and
documentation of LLS.
